## Technical Architecture

### API Endpoints

#### `/api/chat`

**POST** - Chat with AI assistant using OpenAI function calling

```typescript
{
  message: string;
  conversation?: Array<{role: 'user' | 'assistant', content: string}>;
}
```

Response:

```typescript
{
  message: string;
  usage?: OpenAI.Usage;
}
```

### OpenAI Function Calling Integration

The AI assistant uses OpenAI's function calling feature to dynamically access data:

#### Function Calling Flow

1. **User Query**: User asks a question in natural language
2. **Function Selection**: OpenAI determines which function(s) to call
3. **Data Retrieval**: Functions fetch real-time data from SQLite database
4. **Response Generation**: AI formulates response with fresh data
5. **Markdown Rendering**: Response is displayed with proper formatting

#### Available Functions

1. **`get_inventory`** - Retrieve current inventory data

   - Parameters: `category` (optional), `markLevel` (optional)
   - Returns: Current stock quantities for specified or all parts

2. **`get_schematics`** - Search and filter schematics database

   - Parameters: `query` (optional), `category` (optional), `markLevel` (optional)
   - Returns: Matching schematics with detailed information

3. **`analyze_stock_levels`** - Comprehensive stock analysis
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: Stock level analysis with recommendations

#### Benefits

- **ðŸ”„ Always Fresh**: Data fetched in real-time, never stale
- **ðŸ’¡ Smart**: AI chooses appropriate functions automatically
- **ðŸ’° Efficient**: Only fetches needed data, reducing API costs
- **ðŸŽ¯ Precise**: Targeted queries for specific information

## Usage Examples

### Inventory Analysis

```
User: "What parts am I critically low on?"
AI: "Based on your current inventory analysis, you have zero stock of:
- Booster components (all mark levels)
- Most Reactor parts
- Several Shield components

I recommend prioritizing Booster Mark I and II parts as they're commonly used in many ship builds."
```

### Production Planning

```
User: "What's the most profitable thing I can build right now?"
AI: "Looking at your current stock levels, you have good supplies of:
- Armor Mark II (9 units)
- Engine Mark III (7 units)
- Capacitor Mark IV (4 units)

These are commonly used in mid-tier ship builds. I'd recommend focusing on Mark III Heavy Engine builds as they have good profit margins and you have sufficient stock."
```

### Stock Management

```
User: "Set recommended stock levels for all parts"
AI: "I can help you optimize stock levels! Based on typical usage patterns:
- Keep 10-15 units of Mark I and II parts (high turnover)
- Maintain 5-8 units of Mark III and IV parts (moderate usage)
- Stock 2-5 units of Mark V parts (specialty builds)

Would you like me to analyze specific categories for more detailed recommendations?"
```

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling for:

- Missing or invalid API keys
- Network connectivity issues
- OpenAI API rate limits
- Malformed requests

## Security

### Best Practices

- Store API keys securely in environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper error handling to avoid key exposure

### Data Privacy

- Inventory data stays within your local system
- Only necessary context is sent to OpenAI
- No personal or sensitive information is transmitted
- Conversation history is stored locally only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API Key Required" Error**

   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
   - Verify the API key is valid and active
   - Check for typos in the environment variable name

2. **"Failed to send message" Error**

   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify OpenAI API service status
   - Ensure you have sufficient API credits

3. **Slow Response Times**

   - Large inventory databases may increase response time
   - Consider using a more powerful OpenAI model
   - Check your internet connection speed

4. **Context Errors**
   - Restart the application to refresh data context
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify schematics data is properly loaded

### Support

For technical issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pnpm install`)
4. Check the application logs for detailed error information
